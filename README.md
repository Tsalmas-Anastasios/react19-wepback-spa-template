## Steps to setup and run the development environment:

- git clone the current repository
- Open the project inside a terminal (or your IDE)
- Choose the appropriate node version. In **Windows** run the command `nvm use <node-version>`. This `<node-version>` is described inside the `.nvmrc` file. If you have not install this version yet in your system, run the command `nvm install <node-version>` first and then the `nvm use <node-version>` command. For **Unix/Linux** based systems, run the command `nvm use` in order to use the appropriate node version, as described inside the .nvmrc file. If you prompt to install this version first, run the command `nvm install` and then run `nvm use`.
- Run `npm i` or better prefer the safe node modules installation, `npm ci`
- Create a file `.env` in the root of the project
- Copy all the contents of the file `.env.template` inside the file `.env`
- Run `npm run front:dev` and see the result in your browser in address `http://localhost:3000`
